# Usage

```{r module_usage}
library(SpaDES)

setPaths(modulePath = file.path("Z:/GitHub"),
         inputPath = file.path("Z:/GitHub"),
         outputPath = file.path("Z:/GitHub"),
         cachePath = file.path("Z:/GitHub"))
getPaths() # shows where the 4 relevant paths are

times <- list(start = 0, end = 10)

parameters <- list(
  #.progress = list(type = "text", interval = 1), # for a progress bar
  ## If there are further modules, each can have its own set of parameters:
  #module1 = list(param1 = value1, param2 = value2),
  #module2 = list(param1 = value1, param2 = value2)
)
modules <- list("caribouPopGrowthModel")
objects <- list()
inputs <- list()
outputs <- list()

caribous <- simInitAndSpades(times = times, params = parameters, modules = modules,
                 objects = objects)

## Input data

How to obtain input data, and a description of the data required by the module.
If `sourceURL` is specified, `downloadData("caribouPopGrowthModel", "path/to/modules/dir")` may be sufficient.

## Output data

Description of the module outputs.

# Links to other modules

Describe any anticipated linkages to other modules.

# Assumptions of this module - to be stated explicitly in written reports and publications

**POPULATION MODELS - output N (population size)**
1. For all population models (MODEL OPTION 1 THROUGH 5):
ASSUMPTION A: The statistical relationship between recruitment and the landscape described by ECCC 2012 is the correct relationship for NWT boreal caribou. (Model M3, recruitment ~ total disturbance; ECCC 2012 Table 56). This relationship was generated off of 24 data points of caribou study areas across Canada, and lacks information on study areas primarily driven by fire.

ASSUMPTION B: Initial population of boreal caribou across the North West Territories Taiga Plains is 6731 individuals (James Hodgson pers. comm.; Gov NWT 2019)
Government of the Northwest Territories. 2019. A Framework for Boreal Caribou Range Planning: Revised Draft - Appendices. Environment and Natural Resources, Government of the Northwest Territories, Yellowknife, NT. 38 + ii pp.

2. For logarithmic population growth models (MODEL OPTION 4): - to do for future projects
ASSUMPTION C: The carrying capacity of boreal caribou in the North West Territories Taiga Plains is 10,000 individuals 

ASSUMPTION D: The intrinsic rate (r) of increase of boreal caribou in the North West Territories Taiga Plains is 10% (r = 0.10; Sutherland et al. in prep). Currently obtained from Sutherland et al. (in prep) demonstrating that recruitment needs to be > 0.1 for annual population growth

3. For stochastic population growth models (MODEL OPTION 5 & 6): - to do for future projects
Still to be completed


**POPULATION GROWTH MODELS - output lambda (population growth rate)**
1. For population growth model (MODEL OPTION 3):
