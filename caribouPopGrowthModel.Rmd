# Usage

```{r module_usage}
library(SpaDES)

setPaths(modulePath = file.path("/home/tmichele/Documents/GitHub/NWT/modules"))
getPaths() # shows where the 4 relevant paths are

times <- list(start = 0, end = 10)

parameters <- list(
  #.progress = list(type = "text", interval = 1), # for a progress bar
  ## If there are further modules, each can have its own set of parameters:
  #module1 = list(param1 = value1, param2 = value2),
  #module2 = list(param1 = value1, param2 = value2)
)
modules <- list("caribouPopGrowthModel")
objects <- list()
inputs <- list()
outputs <- list()

caribous <- simInitAndSpades(times = times, params = parameters, modules = modules,
                 objects = objects)

# Events

*Model objective:* plot and save both popultion growth rate and population size of woodland boreal caribou across the North West Territories. This module is based off of the reported recruitment relationship with total disturbance (Environment Canada 2012), which is used as the current boreal caribou recovery strategy guideline todate. Our module here

## Plotting

Write what is plotted.

## Saving

Write what is saved.

# Data dependencies

## Input data

How to obtain input data, and a description of the data required by the module.
If `sourceURL` is specified, `downloadData("caribouPopGrowthModel", "path/to/modules/dir")` may be sufficient.

## Output data

Description of the module outputs.

# Links to other modules

Describe any anticipated linkages to other modules.

# Assumptions of this module - to be stated explicitly in written reports and publications

**1. For all models (MODEL OPTION 1 THROUGH 6)**
ASSUMPTION A: The statistical relationship between recruitment and the landscape described by ECCC 2012 is the correct relationship for NWT boreal caribou. (Model M3, recruitment ~ total disturbance; ECCC 2012 Table 56). This relationship was generated off of 24 data points of caribou study areas across Canada, and lacks information on study areas primarily driven by fire.

ASSUMPTION B: Adult female survival is constant. We used the ECCC 2012 recommended value of 0.85. We assume that this value applies to all local populations of boreal woodland caribou in the North West Territories.

## POPULATION MODELS - output N (population size; MODEL OPTIONS 1 AND 2)
ASSUMPTION C: Initial population of boreal caribou across the North West Territories Taiga Plains is 6731 individuals (James Hodgson pers. comm.; Gov NWT 2019)
Government of the Northwest Territories. 2019. A Framework for Boreal Caribou Range Planning: Revised Draft - Appendices. Environment and Natural Resources, Government of the Northwest Territories, Yellowknife, NT. 38 + ii pp.

**2. For logarithmic population growth models (MODEL OPTION 2):**
ASSUMPTION D: The carrying capacity of boreal caribou in the North West Territories Taiga Plains is 10,000 individuals 

ASSUMPTION E: The intrinsic rate (r) of increase of boreal caribou in the North West Territories Taiga Plains is 10% (r = 0.10; Sutherland et al. in prep). Currently obtained from Sutherland et al. (in prep) demonstrating that recruitment needs to be > 0.1 for annual population growth

**3. For stochastic population growth models (MODEL OPTION 4 THROUGH 6): - to do for future projects**
Still to be completed


## POPULATION GROWTH MODELS - output lambda (population growth rate)**
**1. For population growth model (MODEL OPTION 3)**
Calculation of lambda is based off of McLaughlin et al. (2003). This population growth model was also used in Sorrensen et al. (2006), and Hervieux et al. (2013).
